       @creates_redis_lb_app @lb_check
       Scenario: start application
         Given I have my redis lb app on AppCloud
         When I upload my application
         And I start my application
         Then it should be started
         And it's health_check entrypoint should return OK
		 And after resetting all counters it should return OK and no data

		 # ensure basic operation works fine with a single instance
		 When I execute /incr 10 times
		 Then the sum of all instance counts should be 10
		 And after resetting all counters it should return OK and no data

		 # ensure basic operation works fine with multiple instances
		 When I increase the instance count of my application by 4
         Then I should have 5 instances of my application
		 When I execute /incr 150 times
		 Then the sum of all instance counts should be 150
		 And all 5 instances should participate
		 And all 5 instances should do within 55 percent of their fair share of the 150 operations
		 And after resetting all counters it should return OK and no data
